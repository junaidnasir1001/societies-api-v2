# ðŸš€ Milestone 1 & 2 Submission â€” Societies.io Content Testing API

## âœ… Overview
- Milestone 1: Core API server with single-test flow, normalization, deployment, and docs.
- Milestone 2: Async job flow (start/poll), MCP/RapidMCP readiness.

---

## âœ… Milestone 1 â€” Core API Implementation
- Express API server with production middleware (CORS, JSON limits, logging, graceful errors)
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /health`
  - `GET /api/info`
  - `GET /api/test-types`
  - `POST /api/societies/test-content` (sync)
- Test type normalization: 11 official types + common aliases (e.g., "web" â†’ "Website Content", "twitter" â†’ "X Post", "blog post" â†’ "Article").
- Integrated with automation `run({...})`; MCP-compatible response shape.
- Timeouts: 10 minutes (single test) with structured error handling.
- Optional API key support via `X-API-Key`/`?api_key=`.
- Deployment completed and verified.

### Production URL
- Base: `http://161.35.34.121:3001`
- Health: `GET /health`
- Info: `GET /api/info`

### Example (Single Test â€” Sync)
```bash
curl -X POST http://161.35.34.121:3001/api/societies/test-content \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "societyName": "Startup Investors",
    "testType": "Article",
    "testString": "AI-powered analytics delivers 10x faster insights"
  }'
```

## âœ… Milestone 2 â€” Async Jobs + Batch + MCP Readiness
- Async mode on main endpoint via `mode: "async"` (returns `202`, `jobId`, `Location`).
- Job polling endpoint: `GET /api/jobs/:jobId` â†’ `queued | running | done | failed` (+ result/error).
- In-memory job store (production can swap with Redis/DB).
- Batch endpoint: `POST /api/societies/test-content-batch` (up to 5 strings, sequential with per-item results).
- MCP/RapidMCP integration readiness + guides and test scripts included.

### Endpoints Added/Enhanced
- `POST /api/societies/test-content` (supports sync and async via `mode`)
- `GET /api/jobs/:jobId` (poll async status/result)
- `POST /api/societies/test-content-batch`

### Example (Single Test â€” Async)
```bash
# Start async job
curl -s -X POST http://161.35.34.121:3001/api/societies/test-content \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "societyName":"Startup Investors",
    "testType":"Article",
    "testString":"Async job example",
    "mode":"async"
  }'

# Poll status
curl -s http://161.35.34.121:3001/api/jobs/<jobId>
```

## ðŸ§ª Quick Checks
```bash
curl http://161.35.34.121:3001/health
curl http://161.35.34.121:3001/api/info
curl http://161.35.34.121:3001/api/test-types
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Status
- Milestone 1: COMPLETE (deployed and verified)
- Milestone 2: COMPLETE (async job flow + batch + MCP readiness verified)

---

## ðŸ“Ž Notes for Reviewer
- Async job flow verified locally: job creation, status polling, successful run.
- Normalization covers official types plus common variants; custom types supported via pass-through.
